# Rail-crack-and-obstacle-detection-system
project aims to develop a compact and efficient Railway Rail Crack and Obstacle Detection System. It utilizes advanced sensors to identify cracks and obstacles on railway tracks. The system promptly sends this information, along with the precise location, to the junction master for immediate action.
